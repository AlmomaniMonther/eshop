# eshop

Online shop sample app based on firebase 
The admin of the shop can make an admin account 
then he could add products to the application database
and make any changes he wants.

The user account gives the user access to the products in the database
he can add products to the cart and make orders and pay for it later

For any help or feedback, contact me on my accounts :)
